# Pie chart alternatives

This is just a quick breakdown of some of the alternatives to pie charts that can be created in Python. The examples primarily rely on using `matplotlib` and a few other packages that work with it to create specific charts - [squarify](https://github.com/laserson/squarify) for treemaps, and [pywaffle](https://github.com/gyli/PyWaffle) for waffle charts. A walkthrough of alternatives can be found in my blog article [Creating compelling pie chart alternatives](#).
